# SCAMP(s)
##### SmartCard Password And Memo (storage)

## What is this?
> This project was created, as I am working in Cryptography and co.
> 
> Additionaly, I enjoy the masochistic experience of programming, so here is an old project of mine!
> 
> Buuuuuut...
> 
> It has been __R E W O R K E D__!
>
> Now the password storage is no longer malding about with shitty DES encryption!
> 
> Now we use big boy RSA :).

## Anyways, how do I use this?
> Welp, first off, you got to have an already set up smartcard and a smartcard-reader.
> 
> If your smartcard has a PIN set, you will most likely be able to use this :thumbsup:.
>
> Firstly, insert your smartcard.
> 
> Then Open the EXE you either built from source or downloaded from the releases.
> 
> On the first run, SCAMP(s) will create a Storage for you
> 
> After that, input your SmartCard-PIN in the top-left Password-Box.
> 
> Then you can write your Passwords/Memos into the lower Text-Box.
> 
>
> When you're done with that, just click on encrypt!
> 
> _(also you'd better input the right pin, otherwise the program will kill itself and take all your unsaved progress with it.)_
>
> So... after you have saved/encrypted the Memos/Passwords, the Content-Box will change to the encrypted form of it.
> 
> To decrypt the mess in the file, just click on "Decrypt".
> 
> _(Don't forget to input ur PIN, or u might mald.)_
>
> 
> On the next start of the program, follow the same instructions.
> 
> _(__DO NOT__ forget to click decrypt first, otherwise ur precious stuff gone)_

## A small closing statement
> * This mald-fest is provided as is.
> * I take no responsibility, if SCAMP(s) fucks up the Data you have saved within it.
> * Feel free to use any of the code in SCAMP(s) if you want to
> * _(please Credit me if you actually use some of this code_ :point_right::point_left:_)_

#### So hell yeah, I'm out and enjoy SCAMP(s)!
